Hello, I'm Gabriel Haines and this is my personal website. I'm an onchain artist/content creator with deep expertise in semi-nude image and video content, having published several medium-to-long form pieces showcasing my naked upper body.

I am well-versed with the art of sword fighting and am also known as an extremely skilled voice artist. Since the market is nuking, I had an idea to engage my community of Retardios, and so set up this website accordingly.

The rules are simple: 

1. I regularly post onchain. Collect my content when I do.
2. This makes you eligible to join the Telegram group.
3. Verify that you hold at least one piece of content (using Collab Land) to enter the TG group.
4. New members are added every few days.

The group is mostly a way to get to know my collectors, give them early previews of my content, and even help them shape the direction and/or type of content I make.
